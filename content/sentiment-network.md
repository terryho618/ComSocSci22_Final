The sentiment network is represented by nodes that are colored green, yellow, or red, meaning the sentiment of the artist is positive, neutral, or negative respectively. The node is sized by the emotion of the artist, meaning that the greater the absolute value of the sentiment, the larger the size is. This is to represent how emotional the artist's lyrics are and to see trends within the genres. For example, at the bottom left of the network, there is a green cluster with a lot of big nodes, showing that latin pop is generally positive and emotional.
